# Portfolio Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Inspiration
This project is a rework on the first website I ever built. I loved learning HTML and CSS for that website to create something that I could view anywhere in the world (being able to call my parents and tell them to check out my website at https://atharvagashe.com was an amazing feeling!). <br />
<br />
Since then I've worked on learning some new tools, using Figma to redesign the website, and learning how to build a responsive design.

## Tools
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- Figma
