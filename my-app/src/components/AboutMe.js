          <p>When I was a kid, I thought technology was magic â€“ the way
            code on a computer could transform into real world experiences
            was inspirational to me. At first, I learned java and python to
            work with robots and make some of my favorite (albeit simplest)
            projects. More recently, I've been interested in webdesign, but
            building this website (it's the first time I've spent this much
            time into designing a website) has made me realize how empowering
            it is to see ideas in your head coming to life, and available for
            anyone to view at the click of a button. That's why I'm excited
            to work with DALI!
